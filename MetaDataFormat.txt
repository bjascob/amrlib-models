Meta file must be named amrlib_meta.json and reside in the top level of the model directory.

The following is considered a minimal example of the json file...
}
    "model_type":"stog",
    "version":"0.1.0",
    "date":"2022-02-16",
    "inference_module":".parse_xfm.inference",
    "inference_class":"Inference",
    "model_fn":"pytorch_model.bin",
    "base_model":"facebook/bart-large",
    "kwargs":{}
}

At this time only "inference_module" and "inference_class" are required for all models.
"model_fn" is not required for T5 based models but may be for other model types.
"kwargs" will be passed directly to the instantiation of the inference class.
